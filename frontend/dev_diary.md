# CREST Development Diary

This document tracks major development milestones, decisions, challenges, bugs, fixes, and solutions encountered during the CREST project refactor and enhancement.

## Entries

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: Project Refactor Kick-off & Initial Documentation**

*   **Decision:** Initiated a major project refactor based on the new `project_description.md`.
*   **Task:** Created `project_phases.md` to outline the development roadmap.
*   **Task:** Created this `dev_diary.md` for ongoing tracking.
*   **Next Steps:** Begin planning the integration of fixed and customizable forms and the UI refactor.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: Code Refactor Planning & Information Gathering**

*   **Task:** Outlined high-level strategy for integrating fixed and customizable forms, and for the major UI refactor.
*   **Challenge:** Need more information about the current codebase structure (backend and frontend form definitions, UI components) to proceed with detailed refactoring plans.
*   **Discussion Point:** How to best represent fixed forms in the new system (e.g., as non-editable JSON Schemas) while preserving their specific UI characteristics.
*   **Next Steps:** Awaiting details on existing codebase to refine the refactoring approach. Requesting information on directory structure, current fixed-form definitions (backend/frontend), and specific UI features to preserve.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: Frontend Design Philosophy & Revised Refactoring Strategy**

*   **Task:** Created `frontend/frontend_design_philosophy.md` outlining the UI/UX vision (clinical-scientific, modern, glows, shadows, glassmorphism, bright colors, dark mode).
*   **Decision:** Revised the project refactoring strategy after detailed review of `PreAnestesia.tsx`, `Intraoperatoria.tsx`, and `RecuperacaoPosAnestesica.tsx`.
*   **New Approach:** Focus on iteratively converting existing React component-based forms into JSON Schema and `uiSchema` definitions. This will involve:
    1.  Manually creating schema files for current forms.
    2.  Developing a dynamic form renderer that uses these schemas.
    3.  Adapting existing UI components (e.g., `InputField`, `DrugInputField`, `AutocompleteInput`) into reusable "widgets" driven by the schemas.
    4.  Creating new composite widgets for complex UI patterns (e.g., drug groups, autocomplete with tags).
*   **Rationale:** This approach better leverages the current frontend structure, maximizes UI component reuse, and provides a clearer path to backend integration and the new dynamic form builder.
*   **Next Steps:** Awaiting user feedback on the revised approach, information on the `frontend/src/components/ui/` directory structure, and guidance on which form to use as the first proof-of-concept for schema conversion.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: Schema Definition for RecuperacaoPosAnestesica**

*   **Task:** Created `frontend/src/schemas/recuperacaoPosAnestesica.schema.json`.
    *   Defined properties: `tempoRecuperacao` (string/null, enum), `nivelDessaturacaoPos` (string/null, enum), `outrasQueixasPos` (array of strings, enum).
    *   Included `enumNames` for user-friendly labels for all enum values, including items in `outrasQueixasPos`.
    *   Marked `tempoRecuperacao` as required.
*   **Task:** Created `frontend/src/schemas/recuperacaoPosAnestesica.uiSchema.json`.
    *   Specified `ui:widget` for each property:
        *   `tempoRecuperacao`: "RadioButtonGroupField"
        *   `nivelDessaturacaoPos`: "RadioButtonGroupField"
        *   `outrasQueixasPos`: "CheckboxGroupField"
    *   Included a `ui:options: { required: true }` for `tempoRecuperacao` as an example of passing options to widgets.
*   **Status:** Ready to begin development of the `<DynamicFormRenderer>` component and adapt UI widgets.
*   **Next Steps:** Plan and start implementing the `<DynamicFormRenderer>` and necessary widget adaptations for `RadioButtonGroupField` and `CheckboxGroupField`.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: DynamicFormRenderer Skeleton Created**

*   **Task:** Created the initial `frontend/src/components/forms/DynamicFormRenderer.tsx`.
    *   The component accepts `schema`, `uiSchema`, `formData`, and `onFormDataChange` props.
    *   It iterates through schema properties and currently renders placeholder information for each field, indicating the field name, intended widget, and current value.
    *   Basic structure for title and description from schema is included.
*   **Status:** Skeleton is in place.
*   **Next Steps:** Adapt existing UI components (`RadioButtonGroupField.tsx`, `CheckboxGroupField.tsx`) to serve as widgets by standardizing their props. Then, update `DynamicFormRenderer` to import and use these adapted widgets to render fields from `recuperacaoPosAnestesica.schema.json`.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: Dynamic Form Rendering Test Page**

*   **Task:** Created `frontend/src/pages/TestRecuperacaoFormPage.tsx`.
    *   This page imports `DynamicFormRenderer`, the schemas for `RecuperacaoPosAnestesica` (`.schema.json` and `.uiSchema.json`).
    *   It initializes and manages `formData` state for the form.
    *   Renders the `DynamicFormRenderer` with the appropriate props.
    *   Includes a section to display the live `formData` JSON for debugging and verification.
*   **Linter Fix:** Addressed a type mismatch in `DynamicFormRenderer.tsx` by ensuring options passed to `CheckboxGroupField` have `value` as type `string`, introducing a `CheckboxWidgetOption` type for clarity.
*   **Status:** Ready for the user to integrate this test page into their `App.tsx` or routing setup to visually test the dynamic rendering of the `RecuperacaoPosAnestesica` form.
*   **Next Steps:** User to test the page. Based on results, debug any issues or proceed to adapt more complex forms/widgets.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: Schemas for PreAnestesia Form**

*   **Task:** Created `frontend/src/schemas/preAnestesia.schema.json`.
    *   Defined properties: `idade` (number), `peso` (number), `sexo` (string with enum).
    *   Defined `diagnosticos`, `comorbidades`, `queixas` as arrays of objects, each object having at least `value` and `label` (plus `icd10` for diagnosticos).
    *   Marked `idade`, `peso`, `sexo` as required.
*   **Task:** Created `frontend/src/schemas/preAnestesia.uiSchema.json`.
    *   Specified `ui:widget` for each property:
        *   `idade`, `peso`: "InputFieldWidget" (with `ui:options` for `inputType` and `placeholder`).
        *   `sexo`: "SelectFieldWidget" (with `ui:options` for `placeholder`).
        *   `diagnosticos`, `comorbidades`, `queixas`: "AutocompleteTagSelectorWidget" (with `ui:options` to provide keys for option lists, placeholder, and sub-labels).
*   **Status:** Schemas for `PreAnestesia` form are defined.
*   **Next Steps:** Review existing `InputField.tsx` and `SelectField.tsx` from `frontend/src/components/ui/` for adaptation. Plan and create the new `AutocompleteTagSelectorWidget.tsx`. Update `DynamicFormRenderer` to handle these new widget types.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: InputField and SelectField Widgets Integrated**

*   **Task:** Updated `DynamicFormRenderer.tsx` to correctly render `InputFieldWidget` and `SelectFieldWidget`.
    *   Handles `inputType` and `placeholder` from `ui:options` for `InputFieldWidget`.
    *   Manages `onChange` for both, adapting event-based changes to value-based changes for `onFormDataChange` (including parsing for number inputs).
    *   Generates `options` for `SelectFieldWidget` from schema enums.
*   **Linter Fix:** Resolved a linter error in `DynamicFormRenderer.tsx` by removing an unsupported `required` prop from `CheckboxGroupField`.
*   **Status:** `DynamicFormRenderer` can now handle basic input, select, radio group, and checkbox group fields based on schema definitions.
*   **Next Steps:** Plan and implement the `AutocompleteTagSelectorWidget` for complex array-of-objects fields (diagnoses, comorbidities, queixas) from `PreAnestesia.tsx`. This requires reviewing `QuickSelectButtons.tsx`, `AutocompleteInput.tsx`, and `SelectedItemTags.tsx`.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: AutocompleteTagSelectorWidget and Data Source Created**

*   **Task:** Created `frontend/src/data/preAnestesiaOptions.ts` to centralize option lists (diagnoses, comorbidities, queixas) for the PreAnestesia form.
*   **Task:** Created the `frontend/src/components/widgets/` directory.
*   **Task:** Implemented `frontend/src/components/widgets/AutocompleteTagSelectorWidget.tsx`.
    *   The widget takes `id`, `label`, `value` (array of selected items), `onChange`, `uiOptions` (including keys for data sources), and `required` as props.
    *   It imports and uses `QuickSelectButtons`, `AutocompleteInput`, and `SelectedItemTags`.
    *   It fetches data from `preAnestesiaOptions.ts` based on keys in `uiOptions`.
    *   Includes handlers for quick toggle, autocomplete selection, and tag removal, all calling `props.onChange` to update form data.
*   **Task:** Updated `DynamicFormRenderer.tsx` to import and render `AutocompleteTagSelectorWidget` when specified in `uiSchema`.
    *   Passes appropriate props, including `value` from `formData` and `uiOptions`.
*   **Status:** `DynamicFormRenderer` is now equipped to handle complex custom widgets like `AutocompleteTagSelectorWidget`.
*   **Next Steps:** User to test the `PreAnestesia` form rendering (especially the Diagnósticos, Comorbidades, Queixas fields) using a test page (`TestPreAnestesiaFormPage.tsx`).

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: All Core Forms Dynamically Rendered & Tested**

*   **Task:** Created `frontend/src/data/intraoperatoriaOptions.ts` for Intraoperatória form option lists.
*   **Task:** Created `frontend/src/schemas/intraoperatoria.schema.json` and `frontend/src/schemas/intraoperatoria.uiSchema.json`.
*   **Task:** Updated `DynamicFormRenderer.tsx` to support `optionsSourceKey` in `uiSchema` for sourcing options from `intraOpDataSources`.
*   **Task:** Implemented `frontend/src/components/widgets/DrugSectionWidget.tsx` for rendering complex drug input sections, utilizing `DrugInputField`.
*   **Task:** Integrated `DrugSectionWidget` into `DynamicFormRenderer.tsx`.
*   **Task:** Created `frontend/src/pages/TestIntraoperatoriaFormPage.tsx` for testing the Intraoperatória form.
*   **Task:** Updated `frontend/src/App.tsx` to render `TestIntraoperatoriaFormPage.tsx` for easy testing of the most complex dynamic form.
*   **Achievement:** Successfully tested and confirmed that all three initial forms (`RecuperacaoPosAnestesica`, `PreAnestesia`, `Intraoperatoria`) are now dynamically rendered using their respective JSON schemas, UI schemas, and the `DynamicFormRenderer` with its associated widgets. The core dynamic form rendering mechanism is validated.
*   **Status:** The foundational work for schema-driven form rendering on the frontend is complete for the existing forms.
*   **Next Steps (High-Level):**
    1.  Begin work on the overall UI/UX refactor as per `frontend_design_philosophy.md` and `project_description.md` (e.g., main layout, navigation, dashboard).
    2.  Plan and develop the UI for the "Form Builder" (allowing users to create/edit JSON Schemas).
    3.  Commence backend development (Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, authentication, API endpoints for schemas and submissions).
    4.  Integrate frontend form submissions with the backend.
    5.  Address other features outlined in `project_phases.md` and `project_description.md` (pseudonymization, notifications, RBAC, etc.).

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: Basic Application Skeleton and Routing Implemented**

*   **Task:** Updated `project_description.md` and `frontend_design_philosophy.md` with user feedback regarding agile UX for medical professionals, touch-friendly inputs, and long-term vision (voice/PDF input).
*   **Task:** Created placeholder page components for all main application sections (`Dashboard`, `FormBuilder`, `RoleEditor`, `DataSubmission`, `PatientSearch`, `NotificationScheduler`, `Settings`, `NotFound`) in `frontend/src/pages/`.
*   **Task:** Implemented `frontend/src/components/layout/Layout.tsx` providing a basic structure with a sidebar (placeholder navigation links and icons), a header, and a main content area using `<Outlet />`.
*   **Task:** Configured routing in `frontend/src/App.tsx` using `react-router-dom` to link all placeholder pages and existing test form pages under the main `Layout`.
*   **Task:** Ensured `frontend/src/main.tsx` wraps the `App` component with `<BrowserRouter>`.
*   **Bug Fix:** Recreated the missing `TestPreAnestesiaFormPage.tsx` and corrected its internal state management and prop usage for `DynamicFormRenderer` (from `onSubmit` to `formData`/`onFormDataChange` with a local submit button). Corrected import paths and default import for `SectionCard`.
*   **Status:** The basic frontend application shell is functional. Navigation between pages is working, and pages are rendered within the main layout. The UI is currently barebones, using placeholder icons and styling.
*   **User Feedback:** User confirmed functionality but highlighted the need to improve aesthetics to align with `frontend_design_philosophy.md`, including proper icons and a collapsible sidebar.
*   **Next Steps:** 
    1.  Integrate an icon library (e.g., `react-icons`) and replace placeholder icons in `Layout.tsx`.
    2.  Implement collapsible sidebar functionality in `Layout.tsx`.
    3.  Implement the dark mode toggle functionality.
    4.  Begin applying more specific styling (colors, spacing, shadows, etc.) from `frontend_design_philosophy.md` to `Layout.tsx` and its sub-components (sidebar, header). 

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: UI Enhancement Iteration 1 (Icons, Dark Mode, Collapsible Sidebar)**

*   **Task:** Installed `react-icons` library.
*   **Task:** Enabled class-based dark mode in `tailwind.config.js`.
*   **Task:** Significantly updated `frontend/src/components/layout/Layout.tsx` to include:
    *   Phosphor icons (`react-icons/pi`) for navigation and actions.
    *   State and toggle functionality for a collapsible sidebar.
    *   State, toggle, and `localStorage` persistence for dark mode, applying `.dark` class to `<html>`.
    *   Dynamic page title in the header based on route.
    *   Placeholders for user avatar and notification bell in the header.
    *   Initial refined styling for colors, spacing, and dark mode variants.
*   **User Feedback (Visual Review):** 
    *   Collapsible sidebar is functional but toggle handle icon (`PiMenuIcon` / `PiCaretLeftDuotone`) isn't the desired "minimal button-handle."
    *   Sidebar collapse animation is too coarse; text labels disappear abruptly.
    *   Sidebar navigation items could use better, more minimal visual dividers.
    *   **Critical Layout Issue:** Main content header (with page title) is misaligned with the sidebar's top "PedAir" logo block.
    *   **Major Dark Mode Issue:** Dark mode is perceived as poorly handled, primarily just a dark blue background. Needs significant overhaul to match the (now updated) `frontend_design_philosophy.md` regarding desaturated palettes, glows instead of shadows, text contrast, and component-specific dark styles.
    *   Request to ensure sidebar auto-collapses on small screens (this was implemented, user likely reiterating its importance).
*   **Task:** Updated `frontend_design_philosophy.md` with much more detailed specifications for:
    *   Sidebar behavior (collapsible handle, collapsed state, dividers, animation, small screen adaptation).
    *   Dark Mode aesthetics (rethinking shadows/elevation with glows, desaturated palette, text contrast, glassmorphism considerations, specific component styling for buttons/inputs).
    *   Layout alignment principles.
*   **Next Steps:** 
    1.  Prioritize fixing the header misalignment.
    2.  Undertake a more thorough dark mode styling pass on `Layout.tsx` and core page elements (e.g., cards in `DashboardPage.tsx`) based on the updated philosophy.
    3.  Refine sidebar toggle handle, animation, and item dividers.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: UI Rendering Bug & Dark Mode Refinement Continuation**

*   **Issue Encountered:** After applying glow effects, the application started rendering a plain white screen. Vite HMR also showed connection lags.
*   **Troubleshooting:** User confirmed restarting Vite resolved the white screen issue, suggesting a Tailwind CSS build/cache problem with the new arbitrary shadow classes, rather than a fundamental code error.
*   **Fix Applied (Preventative):** Removed a potentially problematic secondary arbitrary shadow class (`dark:shadow-slate-950/50`) from `Layout.tsx` that was combined with another. The primary arbitrary shadows for subtle dark glows were kept but made even more subtle (`rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`).
*   **User Confirmation:** UI rendering correctly after Vite restart.
*   **Status:** Dark mode styling applied to dashboard cards (glows), layout elements (subtle dark shadows), and basic dark styles applied to all placeholder pages.
*   **Clarification from User:** The three initial forms (`Intraoperatoria`, `PreAnestesia`, `RecuperacaoPosAnestesica`) will be conceptualized as a default form type named "ana_ERAS".
*   **Next Steps (Refined Plan):**
    1.  **Comprehensive Dark Mode for Core UI Components:** Systematically update all components in `frontend/src/components/ui/` (InputField, SelectField, CheckboxGroupField, etc.) to fully align with `frontend_design_philosophy.md` for dark mode (borders, backgrounds, text colors, focus states with glows where appropriate).
    2.  **Dark Mode Review for Widgets:** Ensure custom widgets (`AutocompleteTagSelectorWidget`, `DrugSectionWidget`) correctly compose and display the styled UI components in dark mode.
    3.  **Conceptual Planning for "ana_ERAS" & Form Builder UI:** Begin high-level planning for the Form Builder interface, keeping in mind the "ana_ERAS" default form type.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: Comprehensive Dark Mode Styling Completed**

*   **Task:** Systematically applied dark mode styling to all core UI components in `frontend/src/components/ui/` based on `frontend_design_philosophy.md`.
    *   Components updated: `InputField.tsx`, `SelectField.tsx`, `CheckboxGroupField.tsx`, `RadioButtonGroupField.tsx`, `StepperInput.tsx`, `QuickSelectButtons.tsx`, `DrugInputField.tsx`, `AutocompleteInput.tsx`, `SelectedItemTags.tsx`, `SectionCard.tsx`.
*   **Task:** Reviewed and updated custom widgets (`AutocompleteTagSelectorWidget.tsx`, `DrugSectionWidget.tsx`) to ensure their direct structural elements (fieldsets, legends, internal labels) are dark-mode compatible and that they correctly compose the newly styled UI components.
*   **Status:** All current UI components and widgets now have consistent and complete dark mode styling. The application's visual presentation in dark mode is significantly improved and aligns with the design philosophy.
*   **Next Steps:** Transition to conceptual planning and initial structural implementation for the Form Builder UI (`frontend/src/pages/FormBuilderPage.tsx`). This will involve outlining the main sections (Toolbar, Field Palette, Form Canvas, Property Inspector) and creating basic placeholder components for them.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: Project Description Update & Major Refinements**

*   **Task:** Reviewed the updated `project_description.md` provided by the user.
*   **Key Findings & Impacts:**
    *   **Step-by-Step Form UX:** The new description mandates a "Priorizar Campo Único Visível" approach for clinical forms, meaning forms should be presented section-by-section or field-by-field. This requires a significant refactor of `DynamicFormRenderer.tsx` and `DataSubmissionPage.tsx`.
    *   **Form Versioning:** Schemas will have versions, impacting how forms are selected and rendered.
    *   **Detailed Page Functionality:** More specific requirements for Dashboard (project creation), Form Builder (drag & drop, conditional logic, versioning), Role Editor (fine-grained permissions), Patient Search (specific input fields), and Notification Scheduler.
    *   **Patient Input for Pseudonymization:** Clearer definition of collecting initials, gender, DOB during data submission.
    *   **Enhanced Consent UI:** Multilayer consent (Project, Form, Recontact) will need specific UI elements.
*   **Decision:** Prioritize refactoring the form submission process for step-by-step UX before diving deeper into Form Builder advanced features.
*   **Next Steps (Revised Plan):**
    1.  **Documentation Updates:**
        *   Update `frontend_design_philosophy.md` with the step-by-step form principle.
        *   Update `project_phases.md` to align with the new detailed feature descriptions and UX requirements.
    2.  **Frontend Refactor (Step-by-Step Forms):** Plan and implement changes to `DynamicFormRenderer.tsx` and `DataSubmissionPage.tsx` for sectioned form presentation.
    3.  **Resume Form Builder Development:** Continue with `FormBuilderPage.tsx` after the core form submission UX is updated.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: Step-by-Step Form UX Implemented & Page Placeholders Updated**

*   **Task:** Refactored `DynamicFormRenderer.tsx` to accept a `currentStepIndex` prop, enabling it to render only one top-level schema property (section) at a time. Form title/description visibility adjusted for stepped view.
*   **Task:** Significantly updated `DataSubmissionPage.tsx` to implement the "Priorizar Campo Único Visível" UX:
    *   Added an initial step for collecting patient identification data (initials, gender, DOB) using `InputField` components.
    *   Implemented state management for `isPatientInputStep`, `currentStepIndex`, loaded schemas (`formSchema`, `formUiSchema`), `formData`, and `sectionKeys`.
    *   Included an effect to load `intraoperatoria.schema.json` and `intraoperatoria.uiSchema.json` for testing, initializing `formData` with schema defaults (including nested objects).
    *   Created navigation functions (`goToNextStep`, `goToPreviousStep`) and buttons.
    *   Added a visual progress indicator for form sections.
    *   Integrated placeholder UI for project and recontact consent checkboxes.
    *   Utilizes the modified `DynamicFormRenderer` with `currentStepIndex` for section-by-section display.
*   **Linter Fixes:** 
    *   Modified `InputField.tsx` to add `'date'` to the allowed `type` prop values.
    *   Adjusted `DataSubmissionPage.tsx` to use `event.target.id` instead of `event.target.name` in `handlePatientInputChange` and removed the `name` prop from `InputField` calls, resolving linter errors.
*   **Task:** Updated `DashboardPage.tsx` to include a placeholder "Create New Project" button.
*   **Task:** Updated `PatientSearchPage.tsx` placeholder text and added a sample input field to reflect the required search format (Initials + Gender + DOB + Project ID).
*   **Status:** The core step-by-step form submission flow is now functional on the frontend. Placeholders for key actions and information on other pages have been updated.
*   **Next Steps:** 
    1.  Modify `DataSubmissionPage.tsx` to include an initial "Form Selection" step, allowing dynamic loading of different form schemas (e.g., Intraop, PreAnest, Recuperacao) instead of hardcoding one. This will make the data submission process more versatile.
    2.  Proceed with `FormBuilderPage.tsx` development (MVP 1) after the data submission flow is further refined.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: Data Submission Page Refactored for Dynamic Form Selection & Loading**

*   **Task:** Significantly refactored `DataSubmissionPage.tsx` to introduce a multi-step submission process:
    1.  **Form Selection Step:** Users can now choose from a predefined list of forms (Intraoperatória, Pré-Anestesia, Recuperação Pós-Anestésica).
    2.  **Dynamic Schema Loading:** Schemas (.schema.json, .uiSchema.json) are dynamically imported using `import()` with `/* @vite-ignore */` comments when a form is selected.
    3.  **Patient Identification Step:** Remains the same.
    4.  **Form Filling Step:** Uses the dynamically loaded schemas for the selected form, rendered section by section via `DynamicFormRenderer`.
*   **State Management:** Updated to use `currentProcessStep` ('formSelection', 'patientInput', 'formFilling') to manage the flow. Implemented `isLoadingSchema` for loading states and `resetFormState` for clearing form data when navigating or submitting.
*   **Navigation:** `goToNextStep` and `goToPreviousStep` logic updated to accommodate the new multi-step process.
*   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling and loading indicators added for the schema import process.
*   **Status:** The data submission page is now more versatile, allowing users to select which form to complete. This is a major step towards the flexible form system envisioned.
*   **Next Steps:** Begin development of the `FormBuilderPage.tsx` (MVP 1), focusing on enabling users to view and edit the raw JSON for form schemas and UI schemas, along with basic metadata.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: Form Builder MVP 1 Implemented (Raw JSON Editors)**

*   **Task:** Developed the initial version (MVP 1) of the `FormBuilderPage.tsx`.
*   **New Components Created:**
    *   `frontend/src/components/forms/FormBuilderToolbar.tsx`: Provides actions like "New Blank Form," "Load Form (Placeholder)," and "Save Form (Placeholder)."
    *   `frontend/src/components/forms/FormMetadataEditor.tsx`: Allows editing of form title and description, and displays the form version.
    *   `frontend/src/components/forms/SchemaEditor.tsx`: A reusable component with a textarea for raw JSON editing, including live JSON parsing and error display. Used for both main data schema and UI schema.
*   **`FormBuilderPage.tsx` Updates:**
    *   Integrated the new components into a two-column layout (Metadata & UI Schema on the left, Main Schema on the right).
    *   Implemented state management for form metadata, schema JSON strings (initialized with sample valid JSON), and parsing error messages.
    *   Included `onChange` handlers for schema text areas that update state and validate JSON in real-time.
    *   `onNewForm` action resets the editors to a basic empty schema structure.
*   **Status:** The Form Builder MVP 1 is functional, allowing users to directly edit and validate the JSON for both form schemas and their associated metadata. This lays the groundwork for more advanced form building features.
*   **Next Steps (as per `project_phases.md`):** Proceed to Phase 3.2: Role Editor (MVP 1 - Basic Role & Permission Management), which involves developing the initial UI in `RoleEditorPage.tsx` for creating, viewing, and listing project-specific roles and assigning high-level permissions.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: Role Editor MVP 1 Implemented (Mock Data)**

*   **Task:** Developed the initial version (MVP 1) of the `RoleEditorPage.tsx` using mock data.
*   **Core Functionality:**
    *   **Role Listing & Selection:** Displays a list of predefined mock roles. Users can select a role to view/edit its details.
    *   **Role Creation:** A "Create New Role" button allows users to initiate the creation of a new role.
    *   **Role Editing Form:** When a role is selected or being created, a form appears allowing modification of:
        *   Role Name (InputField)
        *   Role Description (Textarea)
        *   Permissions (Checkboxes based on a mock list: Submit Forms, View Submissions, Edit Project Settings, Manage Users, Build Forms).
    *   **State Management:** Implemented local state to manage the list of roles, the currently selected/editing role, input field values, and selected permissions.
    *   **Mock Save/Create:** "Save" and "Create" actions update the local mock `roles` array and provide user feedback via alerts.
*   **Layout:** Uses a two-column layout. The left column lists roles, and the right column displays the editor/creator form or a placeholder message.
*   **Status:** The Role Editor MVP 1 provides a functional UI for basic role management operations, currently operating on mock data. This serves as a solid foundation for future backend integration.
*   **Next Steps (as per `project_phases.md`):** 
    1. Phase 3.3: Data Submission Flow Refinement - Enhance `DataSubmissionPage.tsx` to load the list of available forms (and their versions) from a (mocked or eventually real) API endpoint instead of a hardcoded list. This sets the stage for backend integration of form definitions.
    2. Phase 4: Backend - API Expansion & Core Logic Implementation - Begin work on the backend APIs to support the Form Builder and Role Editor functionality, including database interactions.

---

**YYYY-MM-DD: Critical Feedback & Architectural Refactoring Plan**

*   **User Feedback Received:** Significant concerns raised regarding state management, component reusability, codebase size, UI data management, fundamental understanding of project-centric UI flow, and RBAC misalignment with `project_description.md`.
*   **Acknowledgement:** The feedback is valid and highlights a premature dive into feature-specific MVP development without establishing a robust project-contextual and role-based architectural foundation on the frontend.
*   **Decision:** Immediate pause on new feature development to address these core architectural issues.
*   **Refactoring Plan - Key Objectives:**
    1.  **Establish Project Context:** Implement a mechanism for selecting an "active project" that influences the entire UI/UX.
    2.  **Introduce Global State (Mocked Auth/Roles):** Create contexts to manage (mocked) authenticated user details and their roles *within the active project*.
    3.  **Revamp `DashboardPage` as Project Launch Pad:** Users will select projects from the dashboard.
    4.  **Conditional Navigation & Access Control:** Sidebar links and page access (e.g., to `FormBuilderPage`, `RoleEditorPage`) will be conditional based on active project selection and user's role in that project.
    5.  **Make Pages Project-Aware:** Existing tool pages will be refactored to operate within the scope of the selected project.
*   **Impact:** This refactoring aims to create a more scalable, maintainable frontend that accurately reflects the multi-project, role-based nature of PedAir as described in `project_description.md`.
*   **Next Steps:**
    1.  Update `project_phases.md` to incorporate this new architectural refactoring phase.
    2.  Begin implementation of `ProjectContext` and mocked `AuthContext`.
    3.  Refactor `DashboardPage.tsx` to serve as the project launchpad.
    4.  Modify `Layout.tsx` and routing in `App.tsx` for conditional navigation based on project context and roles.

## 2024-01-15 - UI/UX Refinement & Design Philosophy Implementation

### Major UI/UX Improvements Completed

#### ✅ Icon-Text Color Consistency
- **Issue**: Icons and text had mismatched colors (e.g., "Appearance", "User Profile", "Notifications", "System Information")
- **Solution**: Implemented new design rule - icons MUST match text colors exactly
- **Implementation**: Updated SettingsPage.tsx headers to use consistent color classes
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `frontend/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` - Fixed all header icon-text color mismatches
  - `frontend_design_philosophy.md` - Added new UI/UX consistency rules

#### ✅ Active Sidebar Navigation Indication
- **Issue**: No visual indication of current active page in sidebar
- **Solution**: Enhanced active state styling with gradients, shadows, and scale effects
- **Implementation**: 
  - Active items receive colored backgrounds with gradients
  - Light mode: Subtle shadows
  - Dark mode: Glow effects  
  - Scale transform (1.05x) for active items
- **Files Modified**: `frontend/src/components/layout/Layout.tsx`

#### ✅ Interactive Project Selector
- **Issue**: Active project section was static, couldn't change projects
- **Solution**: Made active project section clickable with dropdown
- **Implementation**:
  - Added project selector dropdown with all available projects
  - Smooth animations and hover effects
  - Auto-close on selection
- **Files Modified**: `frontend/src/components/layout/Layout.tsx`

#### ✅ Header Alignment & Mobile-First Design
- **Issue**: Header misaligned with sidebar, buttons not mobile-optimized
- **Solution**: Complete header redesign with mobile-first approach
- **Implementation**:
  - Aligned header content with sidebar width (px-6 consistency)
  - Mobile-first button design (icon-only on mobile, text on desktop)
  - Horizontal scrollable action buttons
  - Discrete, minimal button styling
  - Added page title in header for context
- **Files Modified**: `frontend/src/components/layout/Layout.tsx`

#### ✅ Enhanced Design Philosophy
- **New Rules Added**:
  - Icon-Text Color Harmony: Icons must match text colors exactly
  - Active State Indication: Clear visual feedback for current page
  - Header Design Principles: Mobile-first, aligned, context-aware
  - Project Context Design: Interactive project switching
- **Files Modified**: `frontend_design_philosophy.md`

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Active State Logic
```typescript
const isActive = location.pathname === item.path;
// Applied to both main navigation and project navigation
// Different color schemes for different sections
```

#### Mobile-First Header Actions
```typescript
// Responsive sizing: icon-only on mobile, full text on desktop
className="h-10 sm:h-11 w-10 sm:w-auto rounded-xl sm:rounded-lg px-0 sm:px-4"
// Horizontal scroll container with hidden scrollbars
className="flex items-center space-x-2 overflow-x-auto scrollbar-hide pb-1"
```

#### Project Selector State Management
```typescript
const [showProjectSelector, setShowProjectSelector] = useState(false);
// Dropdown with project list, auto-close on selection
```

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear indication of current location in app
2. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly buttons, horizontal scrolling
3. **Color Consistency**: Unified visual language throughout UI
4. **Interactive Elements**: Project switching, responsive hover states
5. **Accessibility**: Proper focus states, reduced motion support

### Next Steps
- Monitor user feedback on new navigation patterns
- Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Evaluate performance impact of enhanced animations
- Plan for additional mobile-specific optimizations
