# CREST Development Roadmap - Complete Strategic Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive development roadmap for CREST (Clinical REsearch Study Tool), a multi-project clinical research platform for pediatric thoracic surgery ERAS protocols. The roadmap prioritizes clinical UX requirements, data privacy compliance (LGPD), and the sophisticated multi-project architecture described in the project vision.

## Current Status & Foundation

**âœ… Completed (Frontend Foundations):**
- React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS setup
- Dynamic form rendering engine with JSON Schema support
- Sophisticated widget system (InputField, SelectField, AutocompleteTagSelector, DrugSection, etc.)
- Schema-driven form architecture (*.schema.json + *.uiSchema.json)
- Layout with project-contextual sidebar navigation
- Basic project selection and role-based UI visibility
- Three legacy forms successfully converted to schema-driven system

**ðŸ”§ In Progress:**
- Global state management architecture (Zustand stores)
- Project-contextual navigation and permissions
- Clinical UX refinements for touch interfaces
